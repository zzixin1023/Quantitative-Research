### Author: Cindy (Zixin) Zhou
I am a master’s student at Washington University, majoring in Quantitative Finance and will graduate in January 2021. As a student in quantitative finance, I have enhanced my ability and skills in derievatives, quantitative risk, statistical and machine learning models, programming and problem solving. I love working with math, number and coding, and utilizing them to verify and create new things. The profound experiences of quantitative research and tradings gave me bigger but detailed picture of financial industry and quantitative strategy, and aroused my great interest in risk management.

I am a person who is curious and thinking, which means I am comfortable with ambiguity, fueled by a hunger to learn and constantly seeking out new challenges with open mind and critical thinking. I am interested in developing new and innovative approaches to handle real world financially puzzles.
